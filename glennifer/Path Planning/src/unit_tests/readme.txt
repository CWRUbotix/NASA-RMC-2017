The functional test for AStar utilizes the AP Comupter Science Gridworld Code to 
test the path planning function of the AStar.java class.

Unfortunately, this is my first time using github, so I'm not sure if the Gridworld code
will work on your computers. If they don't, hit me up on Slack and I'll try my best.

Controls for AStarRunner:
1) Hold 's' and click to set the start point
2) Hold 'e' and click to set the end point
3) Hold 'o' and keep clicking to set the boundaries of an obstacle

Thanks,
Shota
