The functional test for AStar utilizes the AP Comupter Science Gridworld Code to 
test the path planning function of the AStar.java class.

Unfortunately, this is my first time using github, so I'm not sure if the Gridworld code
will work on your computers. If they don't, hit me up on Slack and I'll try my best.

Thanks,
Shota
